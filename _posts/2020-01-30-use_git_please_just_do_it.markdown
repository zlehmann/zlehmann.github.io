I graduated from Flatiron web developer bootcamp almost exaclty 6 months ago. Since that time I have done the following:
* Written 27 technical blogs
* Pushed 169 commits to my Github account
* Networked with 233 people in New York
* Applied to 65 tech jobs
* Was rejected from every single one of them
* Started using some web development at my current job

It's been a rollercoaster ride to say the least. I knew the school part of this journey was going to be the easy part. I'm a realitively quick learn and I'm super interested in this material, so that was no problem. The job search though has been really hard for me. Failure after failure is pretty hard to keep your head up, but we're still pushing on. 

Since graduating I've actually been able to use my web dev skills at my current job helping build out some web interfaces for these enormous water quality data sets I'm working with. If there is anything I can tell you about my time in school versus this, it is to use version control. 

Anyone reading this, and certainly anyone from Flatiron will already be familiar with Git. But if you work alone, the advantages might not be super obivous to you other than getting little green boxes on your Github account's profile page. So let me take a moment while I sip my beer and tell you just how much better life is with Git (or any version control).

Up until recently I just thought Git was an "elitist" way of saving your work. Yeah yeah I can branch it and roll it back...cool I guess. It was handing for passing code from one person to another when I did some group project work at the bootcamp. But that was really about it. Well, since using it in the "real-world" I've come to sorely miss it. We don't use any VC at work, because the other person I'm working with has never used it, and we frankly don't have the time to get it up and running while meeting our current deadlines. But holy cow do I wish it did. 

Let's say you work on a feature of a page for a day. It works, you publish it and move on with your life. A week later your boss tells you there needs to be some changes and maybe something new is being added to that page. While you start implementing the new features you run into some problems. Code gets cut, changed, moved around. Now nothing works. Man sure would be nice to have a previous version to roll back to.

Or maybe this new code does work, but a week later something else changes, and you have to revert PART of the page back to a state you had it in weeks ago. Yeah, that'd be nice to have to. Or imagine you could "save as" (read as branch) your current production version and make a bunch of changes to that, or test out some new ideas you have without having to overwrite everything on your server to test it. Man, yeah, that'd be nice too.

Bottom line...use version control. Trust me, as someone who wishes they could go back and do what all my teachers told me to do from the beginning!
