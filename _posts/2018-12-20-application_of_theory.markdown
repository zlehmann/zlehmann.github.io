I can't speak for all Flatiron students, but I know for me the hardest part this entire journey so far aren't the concepts, or the abstraction. It's the actual implementation of the theory. Looping is easy! Do this thing this number of times. What's the syntax for that again? I've worked with databases most of my professional life! How do I link a class to a table with activerecord again?

I feel like I understand a lot of the concepts this course has presented me with so far. MVC is something I've played around with for fun for a couple of years, but this is the first time I've really pushed my exploration of it. So then why do I keep getting stuck on these labs!?

Well according to an awesome article I just read (https://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/11/8-barriers-to-overcome-when-learning-to-code/) it's all about practice. The struggle of wading through lines of code getting things wrong over and over is what makes you better at it. You learn the nuances of syntax and how to organize your code to be the most readable. But it's really hard not to blame yourself, or think that you're not smart or talented enough to do this professionally. I think it's important to take a breather when you're staring at 35 failed tests on your screen. Take a step back and remember if it worked you wouldn't be learning!
