I remember back in high school a friend had me over to watch a movie called Hackers. While it remains a favorite movie of mine, I can concede that it might not be the most accurate portrayal of how hacking really works. But those outfits are still sick in my opinion.

Anyway I've always thought hacking and penetration testing (pen-testing for short) were super interesting subjects and now that I've graduated from bootcamp and have a little more free time to start researching the things that I'm most interested in I've started to look more closely at how it all works and how you might be able to get started. I've reached out to a handful of "ethical hackers" in NYC and have a short list of some interesting reads as well as a very very basic run down of what you would need to learn to do this in the real world. 

First and for most you need to MASTER the [HTTP protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYM2zFP3Zn0). What is it? How does it work? More importantly, how can it be exploited? This subject in an of itself is the subject of countless blogs and tutorial videos and can take up a lot of your time but at its core, it is the protocol that defines how a computer communicates with a server and vice versa. This is the protocol that you are using every time you make any kind of request to a remote or even local API. What is fascinating though is how these requests and responses can be exploited to send malicious commands to a remote computer or server.

Next you're going to need to learn the various methods of exploitation and attack. There are tons of good sites on the web for this. Here are some of my favorites:
* [Portswigger Web Security](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
* [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/login)
* [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/lessons)

Once you have a few of these tools under your belt (I'd probably recommend starting with SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting), start testing yourself by participating in bug bounties. Bug bounties are programs that basically award programmers that find bugs, exploits, and vulnerabilities on someone's system. There are a bunch of sites for this kind of program with a few that were referenced to me listed below:
* [Hackerone](https://www.hackerone.com/)
* [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)

Hopefully that is a helpful start to your future in web security and hacking! This subject is such a deep and ever-expanding rabbit hole. Be careful getting into it because once you start scratching around on the surface, it has a tendency of drawing you much much deeper.
