Having recently learned R for work after spending most of my development adolesence working in Python, I thought I'd write down some notes about the differences between the two. Both languages are open-source with large, and opinionated, communities. R is mainly used for statistical analysis, sort of like the next step in matlab. Python takes a more general approach to data science. 

One advantage I've learned from using R is its ability to output graphical representations of data. The ggplot2 library and the tidyverse library make sharing findings from data analytics very easy, and honestly, enjoyable. These libraries, like many in the R realm are developed by people who took the time to realise what the community needed and custom built a solution, and their drive for qaulity shows. If you've ever tried to do the kind of plotting done with these libraries in Excel you'll agree.

Where R may suffer slightly is in its popularity. It is certainly nowhere near as widely used as Python, but that might be a result of the fact that it is a very niche language, whereas Python can be used for a lot of different applications. And that is really where Python shines. You can use it as a scripting language for GIS, build websites with it, and perform data analytics. While both languages can do these things, Python does it "cleaner" and in a way that is more recognizable I think to the traditional developer which is probably why it is used so often. 

A lot of talk on the interwebs around these two languages rotates around who created them. R was built by scientists and statisticians, while Python was built by developers. So a lot of these fights boil down to how vigorous the stats tools are in R. But the fact of the mater is that while Python make lack slightly in this category, the open source community isn't going to let that stay that way for very long. I think in a few more years times the "stats" advantage R is holding on to will erode away and likely eventually be surpassed by Python, as Python has many more immediate applications for its use.
