I have always dabbled in coding since I was in middle school. I used to do web development back in the hard coded html days, and played around with C# in a college course in my home town in 10th grade. I even started college as an electrical engineer hoping one day to maybe get into robotics; but after I transfered into the environmental field a little over a year later I didn't think software development was really for me. I had it in my head that it was something you had to go to school forever to do and that it was such a competitive field I would never make any kind of living doing that. Why I thought studying North American Wildlife with a specialization in mammals and forestry would make a better living...I'm not really sure. Twelve years later here I am taking the plunge. I've always had a love for computers, and I think more importantly, building things. I decided to learn software development because I know this is a field that will only continue to grow, and I want a job where I can solve problems and be creative. I am learning to develop software because I want to build again.
