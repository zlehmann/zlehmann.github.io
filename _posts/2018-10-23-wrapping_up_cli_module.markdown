This past weekend I finished writing my CLI final project! It feels pretty amazing to be moving forward with the program and I already feel like I'm well past where I was as a programmer from when I started. Granted that isn't very far, but still I feel quite accomplished. I really enjoyed working on the object oriented lessons of this module. I never really worked with classes and objects before but finally feel like I'm getting the hang of it. 

It has also opened up the idea of abstraction and I can't stop reading about it. The art of abstracting complex real world situations is fascinating. How simply thinking about your code can influence how you build it. What is this object? what attributes does it have? How does this object interact with other objects? I find that planning process to be really interesting and fun to do.
