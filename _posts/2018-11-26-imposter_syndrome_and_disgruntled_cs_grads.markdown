After going home for the holiday I am in a bit of a valley with my journey to become a web developer (I can say I'm climbing my way back out though). I had a sit down with my parents and were telling them about taking an online course to switch careers. They asked a few good questions and smiled and nodded throughout the discussion, but I could tell they were worried. They were worried I was making a mistake investing this much time and money on a program that really had no guarantee of working out in my favor. They just want to make sure I'm doing what's best for me, they're good parents after all!

But that talk is one of many I've had over the last few months. It's funny when I bring these classes up with people how the reactions differ. I'd say it's probably about 50/50, with half of them getting excited and seeing the potential that this could offer me, and the other half thinking I'm out of my mind. "Aren't you worried you won't get a job after class?" Is a quesiton that I'm getting very sick of answering. The answer is of course I am! Who wouldn't be? 

Another experience I've had is talking with actual software engineers. People in the biz I'm trying to break into via an online course. This are the interactions that make me worried. Almost all of them are the same. They look awkwardly away and say something about how it's a great job if you can get one. I mean I get it, these people went to school for years to get the jobs they have now. Who am I to try to do the same after a few months of "teaching myself." It's these convserations that worry me the most. That person could be on the opposite side of the interview table from me in a few months and I feel like I'm going to be heading into that meeting with two strikes against me already.

That's why I started googling what employers really think of software development bootcamps. It's a fun rabbit hole to go down if you have the time. You find articles all over the place on this topic. A bunch of them will tell you that bootcamps fudge their numbers on how many students find jobs after their classes in a way to promote their service and make more sales. And I'm 100% sure that is true, this is a capitalist driven society people. But that doesn't mean I buy their doomsayer figures that only 5-10% of students actually find work. If that was the case why would so many people be enrolling? Luckily I found a few more credible articles that seemed to be asking people who actually hire junior level developers what they though of bootcamp grads. And it was thankfully the rope I need to haul myself out of this valley and get back to being excited about this change in my life.
