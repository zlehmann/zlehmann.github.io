Learning to become a web developer is pretty daunting on its own. Just the enormity of vocabulary you have to learn to be even halfway useful in this industry can be really overwhelming. On top of that you have to learn so many details about syntax, proper coding ediquette, and to comit every five minutes, that you can forget that a lot of really smart people have been working on this stuff for a while now. 

After finishing my first technical review for my CLI final project, I was taught a pretty important lesson that is probably true for tons of new coders and vets a like. If you sit down to write out a method for some task in your workflow and it seems extremely complicated...there's a good chance someone else has already done it or at least has written you a few helper methods you should check out. 

One of the comments I got back was to google .find. It was sort of embarassing to have a reviewer call you out on something like this. How did I not know something so simply but so powerful existed. It ended up replacing two or three of my methods, each over 15 lines of code, with a single line each. I definitely learned my lesson. Use the tools available to you, there is no glory in reinventing the wheel.
