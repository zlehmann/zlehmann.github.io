I always learn the most by doing. I'm a very visual learner, and I think part of being a visual learner is having to hold something in your hands and work with it to really understand it. A lot of time during my time at Flatiron, I have reviewed course work nodding along thoughtfully, saying things to myself like "yeah that makes sense, I get it." Only to dive into a lab and only have the vaguest ideas of how the syntax is supposed to look or how the objects I'm actually working with relate to one another. 

One of the things I like most about these final projects is it FORCES me to get into the weeds and forge my way through some of these more abstract ideas and concepts. While I managed to get through all my labs up until this point, I'm always blown away by the overwhelming feeling of "I have no idea how this works" everytime I start a project. It's so overwhelming to look at a blank screen and think about all of the details that you will have to consider to finish this project. It's a lot like looking into an abyss. I imagine...I haven't encountered many abysses. 

My final Rails Project isn't anything much different than anyone else's. It has the required model relationships, the login interface, the nested resources, just like everyone else. But I think these final projects are very much about the journey and not the destination. We aren't the first ones to build simple web apps like this. But it's a necessary stepping stone on the path to becoming a developer. One that's equal parts excitement and terror. A week or so ago when I started writing my first migrations for this project there was much more terror in the equation; but now, after checking off all the boxes in my spec.md file, it's all excitement.
