This is a fascinating subject to me. Not so much the technical details of the debate, but the people involved in it and how hotly contested it all is. One thing I've noticed in my short time in the tech world so far, is how "high-schooly" a lot of developers are when it comes to basically anything tech related. You hear so much of X is better than Y. This is dumb because of these reasons. Nothing is that cut and dry, and you can find a lot of examples to prove that just by googling "why do we need separate front end and back ends."

Post 1: [Seven Reasons Why A Website's Front-End And Back-End Should Be Kept Separate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/07/19/seven-reasons-why-a-websites-front-end-and-back-end-should-be-kept-separate/#1e4844cc4fca)
Post 3: [Dividing frontend from backend is an antipattern](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/dividing-frontend-backend-antipattern)

The funny thing is they are both right. There are plenty of technical reasons for why you should segment your stacks like Post 1 talks about. Post 3 is really more of a soapbox rant about how frontend devs shouldn't be considered less sophisticated as their backend counter parts. Which is really where I'm going with my high-school reference earlier. Why do devs have to compartmentalize everything like front end is better than back end? Are we as coders so insecure that we have to constantly pit ourselves against each other in these ridiculous debates? Apple is better than Google, React is better than Angular. On and on it goes. 

I would encourage devs to think more broadly. The right answer is usually something more along the lines of X is better than Y in these circumstances... Break out of the habitat of making everything you encounter a diachotomous key of better or worse and really understand why one option is different instead. 

As for why you should separate your back and front ends, I highly suggest reading the Post linked above. The first one not the second. Scalability is a huge part of everything we do in development and the author of Post 1 really lays out why from a technical stand point this separation is a great idea.
